# /code-review - Code Quality Review

You are performing a code quality review on a Roblox project. Follow these 8 steps. Apply the relevant lens based on what changed. Don't apply all lenses every time.

---

## Quick Reference

**Load lenses below only when code matching that domain changed. Don't apply all lenses every time.**

Key rules:
- **Remote types:** RemoteEvent (fire-and-forget), UnreliableRemoteEvent (loss-tolerant VFX/position), RemoteFunction (request-response, use sparingly), BindableEvent/BindableFunction (intra-client/server internal, never cross-boundary).
- **Data persistence:** ALWAYS ProfileStore for player state. Never raw DataStore. Schema template with defaults, DataVersion, migration functions, session locking, BindToClose.
- **Security:** Validate every remote parameter server-side. Rate-limit all remotes per-player.
- **Performance:** Consolidate Heartbeat loops. Cache services. Disconnect unused events.

---

## Step 1: Project Scan

Read the project directory structure. Survey script count, naming patterns, and organization.

Record:
- Total script count
- Folder organization
- Module naming patterns
- Whether the project uses Rojo/Wally or in-Studio editing

---

## Step 2: Organization Review

Check:
- Scripts in correct locations (ServerScriptService, StarterPlayerScripts, etc.)
- Proper use of services vs standalone scripts
- Clean folder structure (no orphaned scripts, no nesting > 3 levels deep)
- Module naming conventions consistent (PascalCase for ModuleScripts, camelCase for functions)
- No scripts with duplicate or overlapping responsibilities

---

## Step 3: Code Quality Scan

Search for anti-patterns:

```
Deprecated APIs:
- wait( → replace with task.wait()
- spawn( → replace with task.spawn()
- delay( → replace with task.delay()

Code smells:
- Global variables (should be module-scoped)
- Missing type annotations on public functions
- Instance.new() in client scripts (should be server-created)
- while true without task.wait() (unbounded loops)
```

Check for:
- Deprecated APIs (`wait()`, `spawn()`, `delay()`)
- Global variable usage (should be module-scoped)
- Missing type annotations on public functions
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Dead code / unreachable code
- Duplicate code across scripts
- Overly long functions (>100 lines, should be refactored)

---

## Step 4: Architecture Review

Check:
- Module boundaries - Does each module have a single responsibility?
- Dependency direction - Do modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations?
- Circular requires - Any modules that depend on each other?
- Separation of concerns - Server vs Client logic properly separated
- Framework usage - If using a framework, is it used consistently?
- Configuration - Hardcoded values should be in config modules

---

## Step 5: Security Quick-Check

Quick scan for:
- Unvalidated RemoteEvent handlers (server-side)
- Client-trusted logic (currency, inventory, damage, position)
- Sensitive data in ReplicatedStorage or StarterPlayer
- Missing rate limiting on remotes
- ProcessReceipt implementation correctness

> **For a deep security review, run the Security Lens below.**

---

## Step 6: Performance Quick-Check

Quick scan for:
- `wait()` or `spawn()` in tight loops
- Multiple `RunService.Heartbeat:Connect()` in same script
- Large tables without cleanup
- Undisconnected events (memory leaks)
- Unanchored parts without collision groups
- Excessive RemoteEvent usage

> **For a deep performance review, run the Performance Lens below.**

---

## Step 7: Quality Report

Rate overall quality:

- **A** - Production-ready. Clean, organized, secure, performant
- **B** - Solid with minor issues. Safe to ship with minor cleanup
- **C** - Functional but needs work. Ship with caveats
- **D** - Significant issues. Needs refactoring before ship
- **F** - Critical problems. Do not ship in current state

List findings by severity:
- **Critical** - Security vulnerabilities, data loss risk, crashes
- **High** - Memory leaks, performance bottlenecks, broken features
- **Medium** - Code smells, deprecated APIs, poor organization
- **Low** - Style inconsistencies, missing documentation

For each finding, provide:
1. File and line (or function name)
2. What's wrong
3. The specific fix (code)

---

## Step 8: Refactoring Suggestions

If significant issues found, suggest refactoring priorities:

1. **Immediate** - Must fix before next publish
2. **Short-term** - Fix in the next development cycle
3. **Long-term** - Plan for when the project grows

For each suggestion:
- What to change
- Why it matters
- Estimated effort (small/medium/large)

---

# Security Lens

*Apply this lens when security-relevant code changed: remotes, data persistence, monetization, player input handling, or server authority.*

---

## Security Step 1: Remote Surface Scan

Search for all `RemoteEvent` and `RemoteFunction` instances. Search for `:FireServer`, `:FireClient`, `:InvokeServer`, `:InvokeClient` to map the full remote surface.

Record every remote found with:
- Name
- Location (ReplicatedStorage path)
- Direction (Client→Server, Server→Client, Client↔Server)
- What it appears to do

---

## Security Step 2: Validation Check

For each remote, verify:
- **Argument type checking** - Server validates `typeof(arg)` for every parameter
- **Range validation** - Numeric inputs checked against min/max bounds
- **Cooldown enforcement** - Rate limiting prevents spam/exploitation
- **Authorization check** - Server verifies the requesting player owns the action
- **Sanitization** - String inputs cleaned, no injection vectors

Flag any remote that accepts input without full server-side validation.

---

## Security Step 3: Client Trust Audit

Search for client-side logic that should be server-side:
- Currency operations (giving/removing coins, cash, gems)
- Inventory changes (adding/removing items)
- Damage calculation (should be server-authoritative)
- Position setting (teleporting, movement authority)
- Leaderboard/stat modification
- Game state changes (win/lose conditions)

**Rule:** If it affects game state or other players, it must be server-validated.

---

## Security Step 4: Data Exposure Check

Verify:
- No sensitive data in `ReplicatedStorage` (secrets, configs with admin keys)
- No server-only logic in `StarterPlayerScripts` (game state, anti-cheat)
- No player data exposed to other players via remotes (unless intentional)
- RemoteEvent payloads don't include excess data (send only what's needed)
- No `require()` paths to server-only modules from client scripts

---

## Security Step 5: Rate Limiting Check

Verify all remotes have per-player rate limiting:
- Track last-fire timestamps server-side
- Reject requests faster than expected human input
- Different limits for different actions (chat: 1/sec, purchase: 1/5sec, movement: 30/sec)
- Log rate limit violations for monitoring

---

## Security Step 6: Vulnerability Report

Categorize findings:

- **Critical** - Exploitable for direct advantage (free currency, item duplication, account takeover)
- **High** - Data exposure or corruption possible
- **Medium** - Potential for abuse with moderate effort
- **Low** - Best practice violation, hard to exploit

For each vulnerability:
1. Remote/method affected
2. Exploit scenario (how an attacker would abuse it)
3. Impact (what they gain)
4. Fix (specific hardened code)

---

## Security Step 7: Hardening

Apply hardened code for each vulnerable remote. Include before/after for clarity.

Hardening patterns to apply:
- Server-side validation wrapper for each remote
- Rate limiting middleware
- Data sanitization functions
- Ownership verification for state changes

---

## Security Step 8: Re-verify

Confirm all vulnerabilities addressed:
- Each Critical/High finding has a corresponding fix applied
- Legitimate functionality still works after hardening
- No new issues introduced by the fixes
- Output a before/after comparison of the security posture

---

# Performance Lens

*Apply this lens when performance-sensitive code changed: large loops, data structures, rendering, network-heavy features, or when the user reports lag.*

---

## Performance Step 1: Project Scan

Search for known anti-patterns:
- `wait()` and `spawn()` (yield-based, blocks thread)
- `RunService` loops (Heartbeat, Stepped, RenderStepped frequency)
- `GetDescendants()` and `GetChildren()` in loops (expensive at scale)

---

## Performance Step 2: Part Audit

Check for:
- Total part count (target: <50,000 for mobile, <200,000 for PC)
- Unanchored parts without assembly (physics chaos)
- Parts without collision groups (unnecessary collision detection)
- MeshParts vs Unions vs parts (MeshParts are most efficient)
- Transparent/reflective parts (rendering cost)

---

## Performance Step 3: Script Audit

Check for:
- Multiple `Heartbeat:Connect()` in the same script (consolidate into one)
- Excessive RemoteEvent usage (batch updates, reduce frequency)
- Tight loops without `task.wait()` (thread starvation)
- Unindexed table operations (linear search vs hash lookup)
- String concatenation in loops (use table.concat instead)
- `Instance.new()` in hot paths (cache and reuse)
- Deep `WaitForChild()` chains (cache references)

---

## Performance Step 4: Memory Audit

Check for:
- Undisconnected events (every `:Connect()` must have a matching `:Disconnect()`)
- Unreferenced instances (created but never parented or referenced)
- Large data tables held in memory (use lazy loading)
- String/internment issues (unnecessary duplicate strings)
- Module-level state that grows without cleanup

---

## Performance Step 5: Network Audit

Check:
- RemoteEvent frequency - Are updates sent every frame when 1/sec would suffice?
- Data size per event - Are payloads unnecessarily large?
- Unnecessary replication - Is data sent to all players when only some need it?
- `FireAllClients` vs `FireClient` - Target specific players when possible
- Debouncing - Are rapid-fire remotes properly debounced server-side?

---

## Performance Step 6: Priority Report

Generate prioritized list:

- **Critical** - Causes crashes or completely unplayable experience
- **High** - Noticeable lag, frame drops, or rubber-banding
- **Medium** - Suboptimal but functional, wasted resources
- **Low** - Minor optimization opportunity

For each item:
1. What's slow
2. Why it's slow (technical explanation)
3. The fix (specific code change)
4. Expected improvement

---

## Performance Step 7: Apply Fixes

Provide optimized code for each finding. Include before/after with expected impact.

Common fixes:
- Replace `wait()` with `task.wait()`
- Consolidate Heartbeat connections
- Add `task.wait()` to prevent thread starvation
- Cache `GetService()` calls
- Use spatial indexing for distance checks
- Batch RemoteEvent updates

---

## Performance Step 8: Before/After

Document improvements:
1. **Metric** - What was measured (frame time, memory, network traffic)
2. **Before** - Original value
3. **After** - Improved value
4. **Change** - Percentage improvement
5. **Remaining** - What's left to optimize

---

# Monetization Lens

*Apply this lens when monetization code changed: GamePasses, DevProducts, Premium integration, shop UI, or when reviewing revenue strategy.*

---

## Monetization Step 1: Current State

Search for `MarketplaceService` usage. Find all GamePass and DevProduct references. List all existing monetization.

Record:
- All GamePasses (ID, name, price, what it grants)
- All DevProducts (ID, name, price, what it consumes)
- Premium benefits (if any)
- Where monetization is presented in-game

---

## Monetization Step 2: GamePass Review

Evaluate each GamePass:
- Is the value clear to the player?
- Is the price appropriate for what it grants?
- Is it discoverable in-game (shown at relevant moments)?
- Does it persist correctly (works after rejoin)?
- Is it idempotent (purchasing twice doesn't break anything)?
- Does it provide lasting value vs one-time use?

---

## Monetization Step 3: DevProduct Review

Evaluate each consumable:
- Is it compelling enough for repeat purchase?
- Is it priced for impulse buy (<100 Robux) or considered purchase?
- Does ProcessReceipt handle correctly (grant then confirm)?
- Are there diminishing returns or purchase limits?
- Is the value clear before purchasing?
- Does it complement (not replace) gameplay?

---

## Monetization Step 4: Missing Opportunities

Based on genre best practices, suggest monetization the game is missing.

**Simulator:** VIP GamePass (2x currency, exclusive pets), Auto-farm DevProduct, Lucky egg/spin DevProducts, Season pass.

**Tycoon:** VIP GamePass (faster income, exclusive materials), Extra plot slots, Cosmetic upgrades.

**RPG:** Inventory expansion, Experience boosts, Cosmetic gear, Character slots.

**Horror:** Skip/co-op passes, Cosmetic items (flashlight skins, outfits), Hint system DevProduct.

**Battle Royale:** Battle pass (seasonal), Cosmetic-only items, Victory animations.

---

## Monetization Step 5: Pricing Analysis

Compare prices against Roblox norms:
- **Entry point** - 25-49 Robux for impulse buys
- **Mid-tier** - 99-199 Robux for meaningful upgrades
- **Premium** - 499-999 Robux for VIP/lifetime benefits
- **Consumables** - 10-50 Robux for repeat purchases

Evaluate Robux-to-value ratio, price anchoring, and bundle discounts.

---

## Monetization Step 6: Premium Integration

Check:
- Premium payouts configured and optimized
- Premium-exclusive benefits (10-15% bonus, exclusive items, priority queue)
- Premium benefits clearly communicated to non-Premium players
- Premium doesn't create unfair advantages in competitive games

---

## Monetization Step 7: Ad Integration

Evaluate if Rewarded Video Ads would fit:
- Natural placement points (extra life, bonus currency, skip wait timer)
- Player opt-in only (never forced)
- Doesn't interrupt core gameplay loop
- Frequency capped (1 ad per X minutes)
- Value exchange is fair (ad view = meaningful reward)

---

## Monetization Step 8: Ethical Review

Flag potentially predatory patterns:
- Loot boxes / gambling mechanics - Are odds disclosed?
- FOMO pressure - Limited-time offers that pressure quick decisions?
- Pay-to-win - Can paying players dominate free players unfairly?
- Dark patterns - Confusing UI that leads to accidental purchases?

---

## Monetization Step 9: Recommendations Report

Prioritized list of monetization improvements:

- **Must-have** - Items that directly increase revenue
- **Should-have** - Items that improve conversion or retention
- **Nice-to-have** - Items that optimize existing revenue

For each recommendation:
1. What to implement
2. Why it will increase revenue
3. Implementation effort (small/medium/large)
4. Where in the game to present it
5. Pricing suggestion

---

# Networking / Remote Architecture Lens

*Apply this lens when networking code changed: new remotes, Bindable refactoring, effect syncing, or when auditing remote surface for scaling.*

---

## Networking Step 1: Remote Surface Map

Search for all `RemoteEvent`, `RemoteFunction`, and `UnreliableRemoteEvent` instances. Search for `:FireServer`, `:FireClient`, `:FireAllClients`, `:InvokeServer`, `:InvokeClient`, and `:Invoke` to map the full remote surface.

Record every remote found with:
- Name
- Location (ReplicatedStorage path)
- Type (RemoteEvent, RemoteFunction, UnreliableRemoteEvent)
- Direction (Client→Server, Server→Client, Client↔Server)
- What it does and whether it carries critical or cosmetic data

---

## Networking Step 2: Type Selection Audit

Verify each remote uses the correct type:

| Type | Best For | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `RemoteEvent` | Fire-and-forget messages | Most common. No return value. |
| `RemoteFunction` | Request-response patterns | Blocking. Avoid in hot paths. Prefer RemoteEvent + callback pattern. |
| `UnreliableRemoteEvent` | Loss-tolerant data (effects, cosmetics, position updates) | Can drop packets under load. NEVER for currency, inventory, damage, game state. |
| `BindableEvent` | Intra-client or intra-server pub/sub | LocalScript→LocalScript or Script→Script only. Never cross Server↔Client boundary. |
| `BindableFunction` | Intra-client or intra-server request-response | Same boundary rule as BindableEvent. |

Flag any remote using the wrong type:
- `RemoteFunction` where `RemoteEvent` + response pattern would suffice
- `RemoteEvent` used as BindableEvent (firing a remote only to reach other scripts on the same client)
- `RemoteEvent` carrying critical data that should use reliable delivery
- `UnreliableRemoteEvent` carrying game-critical state

---

## Networking Step 3: RemoteFunction Check

`RemoteFunction` is a blocking pattern - the caller yields until the receiver returns. This can cause lag if overused.

Verify:
- `:InvokeServer` is used sparingly (not per-frame or in tight loops)
- `:InvokeClient` is only used when the server genuinely needs an answer from a specific client (rare)
- Consider replacing with `RemoteEvent` + response event pattern for non-critical request-response flows
- `:InvokeClient` has a timeout safeguard (client may not respond)

---

## Networking Step 4: Bindable Audit

`BindableEvent` and `BindableFunction` are strictly intra-boundary (Server→Server or Client→Client).

Check:
- No `BindableEvent` / `BindableFunction` in ReplicatedStorage that is fired by server and listened to by client (use `RemoteEvent` instead - Bindables don't replicate)
- Client-side `BindableEvent`s are used for decoupling LocalScripts (cleaner than direct module references)
- Server-side `BindableEvent`s are used for service-to-service pub/sub within the same script context
- No orphaned or unused Bindable instances left in the hierarchy

---

## Networking Step 5: UnreliableRemoteEvent Audit

`UnreliableRemoteEvent` trades reliability for speed. Data may arrive out of order, arrive duplicates, or not arrive at all.

Verify:
- Used only for loss-tolerant data: cosmetic effects, non-critical position interpolation, particle triggers, sound events
- Never used for: currency transactions, inventory changes, damage application, game state transitions, unlock/upgrade actions
- Client-side has fallback logic (if a cosmetic event is dropped, the game still functions)
- Server-side does not rely on unreliable delivery for authoritative state

Recommended pattern - separate critical and cosmetic remotes:
```luau
-- Critical: reliable RemoteEvent
local PurchaseRequest = ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.PurchaseRequest  -- RemoteEvent
-- Cosmetic: unreliable
local HitEffectSync = ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.HitEffectSync     -- UnreliableRemoteEvent
```

---

## Networking Step 6: Organization & Naming

Check:
- All remotes organized under a consistent folder structure (e.g., `ReplicatedStorage > Remotes > {Category}`)
- Naming convention is consistent: `PascalCase` for remote names, `VerbNoun` pattern (`PlayerRequestPurchase`, `ServerSyncInventory`)
- No unused / orphaned remotes in ReplicatedStorage
- RemoteFunction and its response type are clearly paired by naming
- UnreliableRemoteEvents are clearly distinguishable by name or naming suffix (e.g., `Sync_` prefix)

---

## Networking Step 7: Anti-Patterns

Flag these common networking mistakes:

- **Using RemoteFunction in a hot path** - blocks the caller. Prefer RemoteEvent.
- **Using RemoteEvent when BindableEvent would suffice** - a remote that only reaches scripts on the same player should be a BindableEvent, avoiding network overhead.
- **Using RemoteEvent when UnreliableRemoteEvent would be better** - for high-frequency cosmetic updates (position, VFX), unreliable saves bandwidth and CPU.
- **Using UnreliableRemoteEvent for critical state** - dropped packets will corrupt game state.
- **No remote surface map** - undocumented remotes make auditing and debugging harder.
- **Inconsistent naming** - `fireRemote`, `HandleRequest`, `r1` mixed in the same project.
- **Remotes scattered across ReplicatedStorage** - all remotes should live under a single `Remotes` folder.
- **BindableEvent in ReplicatedStorage used cross-boundary** - Bindables don't replicate; this will silently fail on the client.

---

# Data Persistence Lens

*Apply this lens when data persistence code changed: player data loading/saving, ProfileStore setup, data migration, or when auditing data integrity for production readiness.*

---

## Data Step 1: Data Library Detection

Search for how player data is stored:

- **ProfileStore found (recommended):** Continue to Step 2.
- **Raw DataStoreService** used directly: Flag as **High** priority. ProfileStore handles session locking, auto-save, BindToClose, retry logic, and schema reconciliation automatically. Recommend migration. Cross-reference: `roblox-data` §4.
- **No data persistence found:** Flag if the game needs it.

Verify ProfileStore installation:
- Wally dependency: `ProfileStore = "madstudioroblox/profileservice@1.4.0"`
- Or manual ModuleScript in ServerScriptService / ReplicatedStorage
- ProfileStore is required from the correct path

---

## Data Step 2: Profile Structure Review

Verify the `PROFILE_TEMPLATE` (or equivalent schema):

- Exists and is a table
- Contains a `DataVersion` field (number, incremented on schema changes)
- Uses nested structure for non-trivial games (separate `Currency`, `Progression`, `Inventory`, `Settings` sections)
- Every field has a sensible default value (ProfileStore's `:Reconcile()` fills missing fields from the template)
- No Instance references in the template (only JSON-compatible types: number, string, boolean, table)
- Cross-reference: `roblox-data` §6

---

## Data Step 3: Session Locking

Confirm session locking is properly configured:

- `profile:AddUserId(player.UserId)` is called after loading (GDPR compliance)
- `profile:ListenToRelease()` is connected, kicks the player if lock is stolen
- `"ForceLoad"` strategy is used (waits for lock, does not fail silently)
- `profile:Reconcile()` is called after loading to fill missing fields from template
- Cross-reference: `roblox-data` §5

---

## Data Step 4: Lifecycle Review

Verify the full player data lifecycle:

| Event | Must Do | Cross-Ref |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `PlayerAdded` | Load profile via `LoadProfileAsync`, reconcile, store in cache | `roblox-data` §4 |
| Mid-game | Mutate `profile.Data.*` directly, leaderstats sync back | `roblox-data` §4 |
| `PlayerRemoving` | Sync leaderstats to profile, call `profile:Release()` | `roblox-data` §4 |
| `BindToClose` | If using raw DataStore: parallel saves with 30s timeout | `roblox-data` §10.3 |
| Auto-save | ProfileStore handles internally. If raw: 5-min interval, exponential retry | `roblox-data` §10.1 |

Flag missing lifecycle handlers, especially `PlayerRemoving` release and `BindToClose`.

---

## Data Step 5: Data Access Patterns

Check how data is read and written:

- Data is mutated via `profile.Data.fieldName`, not by calling DataStore methods directly
- Leaderstats `IntValue`/`StringValue` are synced back to `profile.Data` before `:Release()`
- Other scripts access player data via a getter module (`getProfile(player)`), not by directly importing ProfileStore
- Data writes happen immediately in memory; saves are handled by ProfileStore's auto-save interval
- Cross-reference: `roblox-data` §4

---

## Data Step 6: Migration Strategy

If the game has evolved its data schema:

- `DataVersion` field exists in the template
- Migration functions exist for each version bump (v1→v2, v2→v3, etc.)
- `DataMigrations.migrate(data)` is called after `LoadProfileAsync` and before `:Reconcile()`
- Migrations are sequential, pure functions (no yields, no side effects)
- Migration for old data that lacks `DataVersion` defaults to version 1
- Cross-reference: `roblox-data` §7

---

## Data Step 7: Anti-Patterns

Flag these common data persistence mistakes:

- **Raw DataStore for player state** instead of ProfileStore - missing session locking, auto-save, retry, BindToClose. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §4.
- **Saving too frequently** - every coin pickup triggers a DataStore write. Rate limits will be hit. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §11.
- **No `pcall` around DataStore calls** - unhandled errors crash the script. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §11.
- **Storing Instance references in DataStore** - Instances are not serializable. Store IDs instead. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §11.
- **No data validation before save** - NaN values or corrupt data can silently break the save. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §10.5.
- **Missing `DataVersion`** - no way to detect or migrate old schema formats. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §6.
- **Session locking bypassed** - using raw DataStore without manual lock implementation risks data loss. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §5.
- **No `BindToClose` handler** - server shutdown loses unsaved player data. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §10.3.
- **Sequential saves in `BindToClose`** - with many players, 30s timeout may be exceeded. Must use `task.spawn` for parallel saves. Cross-ref: `roblox-data` §12.
